This paper compares the application of 5 machine learning
algorithms in different experimental setups. Decision Tree,
Perceptron, Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP), Na√Øve
Bayes and Aleph ILP algorithms are explored to find
suitable predictors for binary, multi-class and relational
problems. The results indicate that the MLP is the best
classifier for large datasets whereas the single-layer
perceptrons are not suitable for the given problems.
Relational learning results suggest that the addition of
background knowledge is beneficial and that relational
learning algorithms perform best on complex relational
datasets.
